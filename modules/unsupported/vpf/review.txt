Jody,
Here is some history on this thing.
VPF (Vector Product Format) is an arcane data format developed by the US Government.  It is very commonly used in our military and intelligence applications.  No one in their right mind would use it for any new or non-US project which is probably why you haven't heard of it.
The Geotools VPF library was started by one Artur Hefczyc, who left the project before I joined.  He developed the low level reading capability (what is now org.geotools.data.vpf.io and some of org.geotools.data.vpf.ifc) but none of the higher level things that would make the library useful.  I then wrote the higher level stuff in 2004 with help from two other people. I failed to develop official unit tests for the library's high level functions.  I know it wasn't very XP of me, but it did not seem worth the effort to set up for two reasons.  First, since the format is very complex, I would have needed a lot of test cases to get any kind of decent coverage.  Since the library is so isolated, the chances of regression problems were very small and I just couldn't justify the time.  Second, unlike most data formats, VPF uses directories of interrelated files.  To read a single feature, you need at least a half a dozen files and probably more.  I wasn't even sure how to add such an array of files to SVN.  Therefore any unit tests you see were developed by Mr. Hefczyc for the low level functions.
As far as IP is concerned, I do not believe Mr. Hefczyc has any personal rights to any of this whatsoever.  I was never able to contact him and would be perfectly fine with replacing the headers with the standard Geotools ones.

- all test files contain this very strange header:
