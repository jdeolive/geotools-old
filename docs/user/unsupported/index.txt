===========
Unsupported
===========

The modules in the unsupported directory have not passed the quality assurance steps required to be included as
part of the library.

Not everything in the GeoTools code base is ready for public abuse quite yet; for the longest time developers would keep
these experiments to themselves. With the use of our maven build system we have been able to "deploy" some of these jars
for those of you wanting a sneak peek.

The following modules are provided for your amusement only; you can use these pages to swap tips, horror stories and we hope collaborate on making these modules part of our library:

Under active development:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   app-schema
   grid
   swing/index
   swt/index
   example
   jai-tools
   gpx2
   
Volunteers needed:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   geometry/index
   jts-wrapper
   postgis-versioned/index
   process/index   
   wps
   geojson

.. note:: 
   
   If you really need one of these modules to work?
   
   Several of the unsupported modules (for example process) are really popular. That does not however mean that there is anyone in the
   GeoTools community taking care, fixing bugs and providing documentation. In some cases these modules are the work of students, in others
   a commercial company that donated the code (but in both cases more resources are needed to make the module usable and trustworthy).
   
   In the past we simply threw out such work - we are trying a change of policy here by letting you see what can be done
   (and has been done).
   
   If you really do need one of these modules cleaned up, perhaps for a deadline, please check out our support page - a
   range of commercial support options are available. Any one of these organisations can be hired to bring these modules up to speed.
