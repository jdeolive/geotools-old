Mark-WKT
--------

Instead of providing a pre-canned set of shapes like other ``MarkFactory`` implementations this one allows the user to specify the shape inline using the WKT syntax, for example::

   <WellKnownName>wkt://POLYGON((0.25 0.25, 0.5 0.75, 0.75 0.25, 0.25 0.25))
   
The plugin also accepts the curved path syntax introducted along with the ``WKTReader2`` class::

   <WellKnownName>wkt://CURVEPOLYGON(COMPOUNDCURVE(CIRCULARSTRING(0 0,2 0, 2 1, 2 3, 4 3),(4 3, 4 5, 1 4, 0 0)))</WellKnownName>
   
It is also possible to create symbol libraries in a property file and refer to them using the following syntax::

   <WellKnownName>wktlib://wkt.properties#ls</WellKnownName>
   
where the path to the library is either absolute, or relative to a search root specified using the ``WKTMarkFactory.setRoot(URL)`` method
