The gt-coverage module provides a way to build and use highly structured grids of numeric values such as imagery data, for instance GeoTIFF format files, or multi-dimensional matrix data, like that found in NetCDF format files.

The gt-coverage module is responsible for:

* implementation of the coverage interfaces from :doc:`gt-opengis <../opengis/index>` such as GridCoverage2D and Format
* Bridging between Java Advanced Imaging, JAI Image IO and Java Image facilities and the geospatial idea of a GridCoverage
* Recognising additional formats available on the CLASSPATH using **GridFormatFinder**
