Common License Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Can I use GeoTools in my Commercial Project?
   Yes. This is one of the reasons we chose the LGPL license. You can build a
   Commercial application which uses GeoTools as a library and re-distribute your
   application under any license you choose. Your users will get a license to your
   application under the terms of your license and a license to the GeoTools
   library under the terms of the LGPL. You only need to give your users some way
   to get the source code of the GeoTools library, most easily by pointing your
   users to the servers of the GeoTools project.
   
   However, if you choose to modify the GeoTools library itself, then you have to
   publish the source code to those changes---the easiest way to do that will be
   to submit those changes back to the GeoTools project so the changes can be
   incorporated into the core source code.

Can I use GeoTools in my GPL Project?
   Yes. This is one of the reasons we chose the LGPL license. You can build a free
   software application which uses GeoTools as a library and re-distribute your
   application under the GPL license. Your users will get a license to your
   application under the terms of the GPL and a license to the GeoTools library
   under the terms of the LGPL. You only need to give your users some way to get
   the source code of the GeoTools library, either by pointing your users to the
   servers of the GeoTools project or by giving them the GeoTools code in the same
   way you give them the code to your GPL application.
   
   However, if you choose to modify the GeoTools library itself, then you have to
   publish the source code to those changes---the easiest way to do that will be
   to submit those changes back to the GeoTools project so the changes can be
   incorporated into the core source code.
   
   Note that this means you can use GeoTools as a library but you cannot
   incorporate GeoTools code directly into your GLP application. Legally, the
   latter amounts to re-licensing GeoTools under a new license and you do not have
   the right to do so.

What restrictions are there on my use of GeoTools?
   None. You can read, run, copy, or do anything else you want to do with the
   GeoTools code. This is one of the four core freedoms of free software which we
   grant you under the LGPL: the freedom to use the software for any purpose you
   choose.
   
   The only restrictions of the LGPL come when you are re-distributing GeoTools,
   that is when you are passing it on to someone else either on its own or as part
   of a larger product, such as when you share it or sell it.

What restrictions are there on my re-distribution of GeoTools?
   Technically, you have to provide everyone who receives a copy of GeoTools from
   you with some way to get the source code to the library. In practice, pointing
   those users to the Geotools project itself is considered an adequate solution.
   
   However, if you are re-distributing a modified version of GeoTools then you
   need to provide users with access to the modified code. This means that you
   must give your users some way to get the modified code such as by publishing it
   yourself. An alternative way to provide your users with the modifications would
   be to work with us to get your changes integrated into the GeoTools library--
   -you could then use the new library directly. The best way to do this would be
   to open a change request on our issue tracker and add to that request a code
   patch containing your changes.

What should I do if I am still unsure what I am allowed to do?
   You can clarify any questions you have by sending us questions to the user
   mailing list:
