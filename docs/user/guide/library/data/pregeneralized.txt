Pregeneralized Plugin
---------------------

This is an advanced plugin that is great for eking the greatest performance out of the GeoTools rendering system. This plugin allows you to smoothly switch between data at different levels of simplification when rendering at different levels.

Consider it something like an image pyramid for raster data operating at different zoom levels.
