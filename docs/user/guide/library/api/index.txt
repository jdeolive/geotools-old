API

The **gt-api** module is where we publish out stable interfaces that are implemented by the rest of the library. 

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   datastore
   parameter
   envelope
   jts
   convert

These interfaces build on the ideas and concepts defined by standards (as captured in the **gt-opengis** module).

The gt-api module provides:

* Interfaces implemented by:doc:`gt-main <../main/index>` such as 
* Utility classes to help with integration such as ReferencedEnvelope and 
* :doc:`gt-main <../main/index>` offers helper classes to translate Geometry into a Java Shape

In general:

* gt-opengis module defines data structures and concepts
* gt-api module defines data access and functionality

* Q: What does API mean?
  
  It stands for "Application Program Interface" (API) is is a contract
  that GeoTools commits to using to make functionality available to your
  application.
  
  The interfaces in **gt-opengis** and **gt-api** represent the formal
  GeoTools interfaces advertises to your application defining concepts
  ideas and data structures.
  
  Additional public methods and classes are added by other modules, but
  they are focused on doing rather than defining.
