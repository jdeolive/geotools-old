Style
-----

The GeoTools rendering process is controlled styling information that you provide. The data structures we use to describe styling are based on the Style Layer Descriptor (SLD) and Symbology Encoding (SE) specifications provided by the OGC.

These specifications define an XML document you can use to save and load your styles on disk, we use the same data structure internally to control the rendering process.

Style Layer Descriptor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The StyleLayerDescriptor concept comes to us from SLD, is aimed at defining how a web map server can draw an entire map (with all the layers included in one gulp.)

Symbology Encoding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Symbology Encoding specification provides us the FeatureTypeStyle which is focused on how to draw features in a manner similar to CSS.

The key concepts are:

* FeatureTypeStyle: captures the recipe for drawing a specific kind of feature
* Rule: used to select features for drawing, using a list of symbolizers to control the actual drawing process.
* TextSymbolizer
  
  Used to control the labelling system; labels are generated by TextSymbolizers and
  thrown into the rendering engine which detect overlaps, sorts things out according
  to priorities you have defined and decides on a final label placement.

* LineSymbolizer
  
  Used to control how lines (or edges) are drawn.

* PolygonSymbolizer
  
  Used to control how solid shapes are drawn.

* Point Symbolizer
  
  Used to draw a point location, the actual graphic drawn is referred to as a Mark with the option to use
  some well known marks (circle, square etc..) or your own external graphics such as PNG icons.

* Raster Symbolizer
  
  Used to control the rendering of raster data with full "color map" control.

The Symbology Encoding standard does its best to render something in all cases; thus a PointSymbolizer applied to a Polygon will draw a point in the centre, more interestingly a LineSymbolizer applied to a point will draw a small line (of a fixed size) at the indicated location.
