Brewer
======

The Brewer module helps you create interesting or appropriate content based on your data. This is as close to the concept of a "theme" as we come to in the GeoTools library with this extension using categorisation functions defined by gt-main  as a basis for the generation of styles.

**FAQ**

* Q: I have 47 classes to represent and ColorBrewer only goes up to 12!
   
   Feel free to create your own Color[] for use with StyleGenerator.

* Q: But why does it only go up to 12?

   This is a surprisingly common question!
   
   Have a look at the http://colorbrewer2.org/ website above; the point of the research is that the
   human eye cannot tell very many colours apart. Indeed the number goes down depending on what 
   you are trying communicate (ie that the things shown are of equal importance, or do they form a smooth spread
   of values?).
