This page contains advanced material and background material that may be
of interest if you are want to build GeoTools for source or take it appart
and see what makes it tick.

Why would you want to do this? We we hope it is because you are interested in
joining the project either by creating your own module or diving in and working
on the core modules.

This material is also of interest if you are embeding the library in a larger
application and would like to make use of the GeoTools plugin system and configuration
options to "teach" GeoTools how to work with your application.
