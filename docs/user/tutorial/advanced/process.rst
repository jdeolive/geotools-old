Process Tutorial
----------------

The GeoTools process system is deisgn in support of "web processing service" style processes
that can be chained together to work on your spatial data. This process data structure is a lot
more capable than the Functions we added to the geotools filter system and is able to work
on large quantities of data as needed.

The general idea is similar in that you get to write some simple java code and package it up
for the GeoTools library to use. 

We have a number of options:

* Annotations
* DataStructure
