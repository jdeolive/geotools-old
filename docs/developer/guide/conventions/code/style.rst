Coding Style
------------

Coding conventions describe the coding styles developers should use when writing code.

For example, whether you use 2, 4, or 8 space indents. Standardising on a coding style across a project improves legibility of the code, and automatic code formatters make conforming to these standards easy.

Sun Coding Conventions and a little bit more
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We follow:

* Sunâ€™s coding convention: http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/
* but allow for 100 characters in width
* developers should use spaces for indentations, not tabulations.
  The tab width (4 or 8 spaces) is not the same on all editors.

But what about the header?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The header for all core GeoTools code is::
   
   /*
    *    GeoTools - The Open Source Java GIS Toolkit
    *    http://geotools.org
    *
    *    (C) 2004-2010, Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)

The header for all demo code is::
   
   /*

Use of Formatting Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get it right the first time - seriously. You cannot expect to go in and reformat your code later in time - because that would make applying fixes between branches of GeoTools needless difficult.

If you are going to take the time to use one of these tools - do so on the first commit. And before every commit. After the code is branched you are stuck.

If you must:
   If you must change the formatting in an existing file; please be sure to do so with a distinct commit. Do not combine code modification (ie a bug fix) with changing the file around to make it look pretty.
   You need to do this as a separate commit in order to have any confidence you can apply patches fixes as they are developed for other branches in the past.

Eclipse
^^^^^^^^

Here are some eclipse settings that you can import when working on geotools work:

* http://svn.osgeo.org/geotools/trunk/build/eclipse/codetemplates.xml
* http://svn.osgeo.org/geotools/trunk/build/eclipse/formatter.xml

To use:

1. Open up Window > Preferences and navigate to the **Java > Code Style > Formatter** page

2. Press the import button and select the file from your GeoTools check out (located in build/eclipse.formatter.xml)

3. Change to the Java > Code Style > Code Templates page
4. Import the template definition from your geotools check out (located in build/eclipse/codetemplates.xml)
5. These files will have the header already to go for you; the right format options and so on.

NetBeans
^^^^^^^^^
 
NetBeans also has the sun settings built in; please modify these defaults to match our project.
