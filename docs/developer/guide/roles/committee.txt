Project Management Committee
============================

Module maintainers who have an interest in the greater direction of the project may have their status promoted to that of a Project Management Committee Member. This committee is the official managing body of the Project and is responsible for setting overall project direction.

The PMC makes all decisions that cannot be resolved by module maintainers. The PMC strives to make as few technical decisions as possible, preferring to leave technical decisions to module maintainers and a general consensus process.
